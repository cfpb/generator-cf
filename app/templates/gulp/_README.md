## Dependencies

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com): task runner for pulling in assets,
  linting and concatenating code, etc.
- [Less](http://lesscss.org): CSS pre-processor.
- [Capital Framework](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/getting-started):
  User interface pattern-library produced by the CFPB.

**NOTE:** If you're new to Capital Framework, we encourage you to
[start here](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/getting-started).

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) however you'd like.
2. Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io):
  ```bash
  npm install -g gulp bower
  ```
3. Next, install the dependencies and compile the project with:
  ```bash
  ./setup.sh
  ```
  __NOTE:__ To re-install and rebuild all the siteâ€™s assets run
  `./setup.sh` again. See the [usage](#usage) section on updating all the
  project dependencies.

## Configuration

_If the software is configurable, describe it in detail,
either here or in other documentation to which you link._

## Usage

Each time you fetch from the upstream repository (this repo), run `./setup.sh`.
This setup script will remove and re-install the project dependencies and
rebuild the site's JavaScript and CSS assets.

To watch for changes in the source code and automatically update the running site,
open a terminal and run:

```bash
gulp watch
```

## How to test the software

After running `./setup.sh` or compiling with Gulp,
you can view the site in a browser by opening `/dist/index.html`.
Alternatively, you may want to use a local server with something like
`http-server`. To do so, run and `npm start` (which starts the server and
runs `gulp watch` to enabled auto-reloading).
